# Overall Notes
## Project Setup
* This project is split up into many directories ordered by lesson number.
* Within each 'lesson directory,' we will have a base folder to start from, and a final folder that is the result of note-taking and following the lesson.
* You may need to setup tsconfig.json files within each directory to make them work without errors when compiling.
    * Just include the files you want to compile.

## Important Notes
* Each file will have *WAY* more comments than necessary.
    * This is to explain concepts though, and not for normal project readability.
